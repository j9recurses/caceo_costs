<h2 class ="myh2profile">  Welcome,  <%= @user[:username].titleize %>, to the Election Costs Collection Pilot Project! </h2>

<p class ="intro"> As you know, the CACEO issued a Request for Proposals to collect election costs earlier this year.
Q2 Data & Research, LLC was selected to assist the CACEO in implementing this project.  </p>

<p class ="intro"> Over the past months, the CACEO Grant Oversight Committee (GOC) has been working with Q2 in designing the questionnaire on this webpage.
Your county was selected to participate in this Pilot project because your county's ROV is a member of the GOC.

<p class ="intro"> With your assistance, we hope to find out what changes and improvements we need to make to the questionnaire before asking all counties to participate.
For your participation to be most useful, please give us feedback on the questionnaire.  </p>


<p class ="intro"> At the end of each section of the cost category section, there is a text field box to enter any comments, questions or concerns you might have
Your comments can range from 'needs more explanation' or 'makes no sense' to 'this box doesn't work' - whatever you encounter: we would like to hear from you.
Don't be shy! Feel free to let us know if there is something you like about the interface too. </p>

<p class ="intro"> For right now, Please only fill out the 2012 sections of this questionnaire. </p>
