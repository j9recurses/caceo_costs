<p class ="intro">As you know, the CACEO issued a Request for Proposals to collect election costs earlier this year. Q2 Data & Research, LLC was selected to assist the CACEO in implementing this project. Over the past months, the CACEO Grant Oversight Committee (GOC) has been working with Q2 in designing the questionnaires on this webpage, and testing them with a few pilot counties. We are very excited that the site is now ready for participation by all counties and we hope that you will find the time to start filling out the questionnaires now that the election is over.</p>
<p class ="intro">In the menu bar of this website, there are three surveys: 1. Direct Cost Categories, 2. Election Profiles, 3. Election Technology. This project spans the ten most recent statewide election years. We encourage you to start with the most recent election for which you have data available and work your way back through the older elections.</p>
<p class ="intro">The Direct Cost Categories survey has two sections: 1. Salaries, 2. Service and Supplies. In Salaries, select the category called Sample, Official, Provisional and VBM Ballots and enter the costs for each of the tasks listed in this category. For example, for the task called Ballot Layout And Design In House, enter how much it costs to layout, design and proof ballots by in-house staff. If this task, or parts of it, is performed by a contractor, please enter the contractor costs in the section Services and Supplies and category Ballot Printing. Please, continue through all cost categories in both sections. Enter only your direct costs in the Direct Cost Categories. The indirect costs are in the Election Profiles section.</p>
<p class ="intro">To gain a fuller cost picture, we ask for the salaries in a couple of ways: 1. all salaries for the various tasks within each category; 2. all salaries, regular and overtime, for the permanent and temporary staff within each category.</p>
<p class ="intro">At the end of each cost category, there is a text field box to enter any comments and concerns you might have. If you don't capture costs for requested cost categories, please let us know in what cost categories you include them. Use the text field box to leave a footnote or contact Jaime at jaimeclark.q2@gmail.com to ask for assistance.</p>
<p class ="intro">To help you navigate the various questionnaires, you can download the Direct Cost Categories Spreadsheet in excel format here <span class = "rlink"> <%= link_to "download the Direct Cost Categories Spreadsheet", "/data/Direct_Cost_Categories_Spreadsheet_Dec8.xls" %></span> and the Election Profile Spreadsheet here <span class =  "rlink"> <%=link_to "download the Election Profiles Spreadsheet", "/data/Election_Profile_Spreadsheet_Dec8.xls" %></span>.</p>
<p class ="intro">The Election Technology survey has two sections: 1. Voting Equipment Purchases, 2. Tabulation and Other Equipment Purchases. Please, enter your data by clicking on the buttons called New Voting Equipment Item and New Tabulation and Other Equipment Item.</p>
<p class ="intro">The site will work best when used with  Chrome and Firefox, and not Internet Explorer.</p>
<p class ="intro">Should you encounter any problems, have questions or want to submit comments, please email the Q2 team by clicking the Contact Us link in the menu bar of this website.</p>
<p class ="intro">We will be checking our email throughout regular business hours and get back to you as soon as possible. You can also email Karin directly at karinmacdonald.q2@gmail.com.</p>
<p class="intro">Thank you for your participation!</p>
